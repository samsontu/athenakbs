Include recommendations that distinguish minor foot problems from more serious problems that require early or immediate professional treatment, together with a name and telephone number for prompt assistance.\n• Make realistic recommendations (appropriate to the patient's physical and visual capabilities) while personalizing information and highlighting key points. This may include a referral to home healthcare.\n• Provide written guidelines in large print and/or graphics that the patient can hang in the bathroom as a reference and reprints of lay articles. Patients should be alerted that elevation in blood sugar might be a sign of an active or impending infection. Use of a night-light or turning on lights when getting up at night may prevent foot injuries. Patients should be made aware of potential dangers in the home.\n• For patients with high-risk feet, twice-daily inspection in good light is recommended, looking for any redness or drainage and running the hands over the foot to detect any swelling or increased local warmth. Patients with neuropathic fingers may need to enlist help or use a mirror to inspect their feet.\n• Before putting on shoes, inspect for torn linings, rough spots, and foreign objects (e.g., gravel, stones, glass, and children’s toys).\n• Alternating between pairs of shoes during the day is recommended. A minimum of two serviceable pairs of shoes, insoles, and orthoses are required.\n• Educators can utilize numerous publications on patient foot care instruction that are free of charge and have no copyright restrictions. The following publications are available through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and American Association of Diabetes Education (AADE): \no Take Charge of Your Diabetes: Prevent Foot Problems\no Taking Care of Your Feet\no Tips on Good Foot Care: from Feet Can Last a Lifetime\n")

Include recommendations that distinguish minor foot problems from more serious problems that require early or immediate professional treatment, together with a name and telephone number for prompt assistance.\n• Make realistic recommendations (appropriate to the patient's physical and visual capabilities) while personalizing information and highlighting key points. This may include a referral to home healthcare.\n• Provide written guidelines in large print and/or graphics that the patient can hang in the bathroom as a reference and reprints of lay articles. Patients should be alerted that elevation in blood sugar might be a sign of an active or impending infection. Use of a night-light or turning on lights when getting up at night may prevent foot injuries. Patients should be made aware of potential dangers in the home.\n• For patients with high-risk feet, twice-daily inspection in good light is recommended, looking for any redness or drainage and running the hands over the foot to detect any swelling or increased local warmth. Patients with neuropathic fingers may need to enlist help or use a mirror to inspect their feet.\n• Before putting on shoes, inspect for torn linings, rough spots, and foreign objects (e.g., gravel, stones, glass, and children’s toys).\n• Alternating between pairs of shoes during the day is recommended. A minimum of two serviceable pairs of shoes, insoles, and orthoses are required.\n• Educators can utilize numerous publications on patient foot care instruction that are free of charge and have no copyright restrictions.
