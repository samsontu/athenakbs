 - Patients: test cases for each rule


TO DO
================================================
 - Collect ICD/CPT codes
 - Make a patient scenario for kidney transplant diagnosis
 - Once PAL criteria for Second-to-Last eGFR complete, make test cases
 - Fix any messages


Patients
================================================
These are patient test cases. "Refers to" is not an exhaustive list, but is a list
of fields where certain

* allfields
---------------------------
Contains every field that is evaluted
Used as the base for creating new test cases (delete components not desired)
Not too useful testing on its own, since it includes all exclusion criteria
