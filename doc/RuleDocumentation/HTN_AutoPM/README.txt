These Rules Documents have been informed by Clinical Guidelines. According to Physician Expertise,
reviewing and critiquing them, they appear to be in draft mode. Once a draft is ready for "Summative Testing",
i.e. in a stable KB, the draft is to be final and included in the Output_&_KB_date_timestamp.

This ensures that Rules Document, KB, and HTML output concord on the same version.
